# Skyward Activity Events

Skyward has an ability to create and share events via their built in calendar system.  The calendar events can be made public or limited to just the members of the activity as well as shown on student/guardian/teacher calendars.  A demonstration of the calendar can be found here https://youtu.be/8sGHY-UoHgQ

## How to get the URL for the public web calendar.
1. Go to you Skyward login screen
1. Replace seplog01.w with districtcalendar.w
  - For example https://skyward.iscorp.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=wsedugatewaypa/seplog01.w  will become https://skyward.iscorp.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=wsedugatewaypa/districtcalendar.w
